- Linear solenoid? 
- Capacitors for power supply
- Controll the force of the kicker (use PWM to controll the capacitors discharge time)
- Some current limiting circuit

## Requirements
- Kicker must generate enough force to kick the ball at high speed
- The capacitor must be large enough to store energy for kicks but small enough to charge quickly
- Solenoid must be durable and capable to withstand frequent, rapid actuation without overheating or lose strength
- The kicker must respond quickly to control signals.
- Minimize energy loss during charging and discharging. 

## Limitations
- heat management
- Material selektion 
- Current rating
- Mechanical wear
