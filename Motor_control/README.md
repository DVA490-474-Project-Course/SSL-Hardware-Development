#### Common BLDC motors
- Maxon flat 40-50W
- Generic 5050 drone bldc motors, this will require gearing, performance unknown.
    - Choosing a drone motor because they have a small form factor and the price is relatively cheap.

#### Comments
- The motors should ideally be as small as possible to reduce weight and leave more space for other components.
