We took an approach that prioritized mastering basic functionality and largely ignored complex maneuvers and skills.},

  abstract = {RoboCup is an international competition to prompted robotics and related subject like: Artificial intelligence, Image processing, control, devise design and etc. One of the subjects in RoboCup competitions is Soccer. Naturally robotic soccer is an interactive and complex procedure. it might be so idealistic, but some consider a challenge with a real human football team in 2050, as the final goal of robotic soccer. There are several classes in robotic football matches such as: Middle size, Small size, simulation and so on. One of the most essential parts of a soccer robot in Middle size and Small size classes in the kicking system, this system is in charge of kicking the ball upon the command issued by the processor of robot. Almost every team develops their own unique shooting device. There are three main approaches to design and implement the robot kicking system. In this paper we designed and developed multi power kicking system that enables loop and vary shooting power. To design a good solenoid and to obtain maximum velocity of ball some parameters like: inductance, response time, resistance, force, dimensions and core-material should be balanced carefully. We used a DC-DC converter (Boost regulator) for getting different currents to have different power of shooting. We are going to review the advantages of all of those approaches. Next we are purposes a novel Solenoid-based kicking system which has already been successfully implemented in Adro RoboCup team.},

In this paper, we develop a multi-agent system to play the full 11 vs. 11 game mode, without demonstrations. This game mode contains aspects that present major challenges to modern reinforcement learning algorithms; multi-agent coordination, long-term planning, and non-transitivity. To address these challenges, we present TiZero; a self-evolving, multi-agent system that learns from scratch. TiZero introduces several innovations, including adaptive curriculum learning, a novel self-play strategy, and an objective that optimizes the policies of multiple agents jointly. Experimentally, it outperforms previous systems by a large margin on the Google Research Football environment, increasing win rates by over 30\%. To demonstrate the generality of TiZero's innovations, they are assessed on several environments beyond football; Overcooked, Multi-agent ParticleEnvironment, Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-Four.},

Its success derives from its focused design and improved capabilities targeting product-grade and modern robotic systems. Following ROS 2's example, the mobile robotics ecosystem has been fully redesigned based on the transformed needs of modern robots and is experiencing active development not seen since its inception. This paper comes from the desks of the key ROS Navigation maintainers to review and analyze the state of the art of robotics navigation in ROS 2. This includes new systems without parallel in ROS 1 or other similar mobile robotics frameworks. We discuss current research products and historically robust methods that provide differing behaviors and support for most every robot type. This survey consists of overviews, comparisons, and expert insights organized by the fundamental problems in the field. Some of these implementations have yet to be described in literature and many have not been benchmarked relative to others. We end by providing a glimpse into the future of the ROS 2 mobile robotics ecosystem.},

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

Opting for simplicity and cost-e↵ectiveness, our strategy primarily employs o↵-the-shelf electronics components and ``hobby'' brushless direct current (BLDC) motors, complemented by 3D printing and CNC milling. This approach helped us to streamline the development process and, with our open-sourced hardware design, hopefully will also lower the bar for other teams to enter RoboCup SSL in the future.

Our aspiration is to participate in the Robocup by 2024, and this article outlines the hardware specifications of our robot as well as the software advancements we have achieved. Our robot, meticulously crafted by our team, demonstrates a harmonious blend of mechanics and technology. Equally impressive is the software architecture of our robot, which integrates algorithms for path planning, ball prediction, decision-making, and more, resulting in an efficient and stable software framework. Our team has been diligently refining both the hardware and software components of our robot, aiming to make it competitive in the upcoming Robocup. Although there are numerous challenges ahead that we need to overcome and areas that require improvement, we are confident in our ability to create a robot that not only meets the competition standards but exceeds expectations.},

  abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is promising for multi-agent path planning problems in which sparse external environmental rewards may cause the agent group to make overly conservative decisions and explore the environment inefficiently. In general, the reward shaping mechanism is used to mitigate the above problems with the additional reward function setting. However, it requires specific domain knowledge, which limits the general applicability, and the added reward functions are not necessarily applicable to all environments. This paper aims to improve the path planning efficiency of single agents and groups of agents with the Internal Curiosity Module (ICM) mechanism to boost the generalization abilities of the agents in different environments. To this end, we incorporate the internal curiosity mechanism into the soft actor-critic model for enhancing exploration strategies, adapting to environmental changes, and improving learning effectiveness. Then, we propose a multi-agent path planning method in which the curiosity mechanism is integrated with the Multi-Agent POsthumous Credit Assignment (MA-POCA) algorithm. The neural networks can automatically calculate the additional intrinsic rewards based on observed information about the environment and the actions taken by the group of agents. Based on our experiments, we make qualitative and quantitative analyses of the performance of the proposed methods and the baseline DRL methods. The experimental results show that our proposed methods can decline the number of learning episodes and the training time of path planning, so the proposed algorithms can accelerate the exploration of single agents or agent groups in the sparse reward environment.}

  abstract = {Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a ubiquitous on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm but is significantly less utilized than off-policy learning algorithms in multi-agent settings. This is often due to the belief that PPO is significantly less sample efficient than off-policy methods in multi-agent systems. In this work, we carefully study the performance of PPO in cooperative multi-agent settings. We show that PPO-based multi-agent algorithms achieve surprisingly strong performance in four popular multi-agent testbeds: the particle-world environments, the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, Google Research Football, and the Hanabi challenge, with minimal hyperparameter tuning and without any domain-specific algorithmic modifications or architectures. Importantly, compared to competitive off-policy methods, PPO often achieves competitive or superior results in both final returns and sample efficiency. Finally, through ablation studies, we analyze implementation and hyperparameter factors that are critical to PPO's empirical performance, and give concrete practical suggestions regarding these factors. Our results show that when using these practices, simple PPO-based methods can be a strong baseline in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.
