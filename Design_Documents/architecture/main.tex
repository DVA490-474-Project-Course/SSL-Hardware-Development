\section*{Reason for component choice}

\subsection*{DF45L024048-A}
The BLDC motor has a high torque at low speeds and can reach high revs per minute (RPM). This is necessary to ensure fast acceleration at low speeds. In order to have precise control of the motors, positional feedback of the magnets position and the phase current can be used to form a closed-loop PID system. The $\mu\text{Controller}$ would only need to send the desired velocity to the ESC and the closed-loop control will make sure the desired speed is met.
On the contrary, using a BLDC motor without sensor feedback, additional components would be required, for example external hall sensors and external current sensing iCs. This would add complexity and introduce integration issues.
We also have to take the size of the motor into account. Having to large footprint on the motors would cause the kicker (solenoid) to not fit in the chassi. Sensored BLDC motors are mainly used for RC cars, where positional accuracy is required for low speeds and they have a larger footprint and cheaper alternatives compared to the DF45L024048-A did not exist. 

\subsection*{Hobbywing FPV XRotor 3110 900KV}
The requirements for the dribbler motor is that it can reach high RPM (around $10\:000\text{ RPM}$). Positional accuracy for the dribbler motor does not have to be as precise compared with the motor for the wheels. Since we have current feedback for each phase we can calculate the RPM of the motor.

\subsection*{B-G431B-ESC1}
The chosen electronics speed controller (ESC) has an STSPIN32F0A system in package chip which has an integrated STM32 with hall sensor decoding logic aswell as current sensing capabilities. This makes this ESC a good fit with the DF45L024048-A BLDC motor. The PID system can be run on this chip for each motor offloading computational loads from the $\mu\text{Controller}$ making this a really efficient ESC for the price.

\subsection*{NUCLEO-H723ZG}
The NUCLEO-H723ZG $\mu\text{Controller}$ is chosen because of its high computational abilities which is based of the STM32H7237G chip. The $\mu\text{Controller}$ will be required to collect the data from the sensors, perform calculations with the data, send the data to the team server.
